Load Timing Constraints

SDC file 'finitesm.sdc' not found
Setting default timing constraints:
   * constrain all primay inputs and primary outputs on a virtual external clock 'virtual_io_clock'
   * optimize all netlist and virtual clocks to run as fast as possible
   * ignore cross netlist clock domain timing paths
Timing constraints created 6 clocks
